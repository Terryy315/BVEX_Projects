# Summer2025
Some of the work I have done for the BVEX project, as references

Contains hardware and software files

Hardware section contains most of the control system for the lockpin

Software section contains some sample analytic scripts for analysing GPS data and beam calibration of the 22 GHz telescope

Research section contains some information on satellites that downlink at around 22 GHz, which can potentially be used for K-band beam calibration

NOTE: I am still actively uploadig my work to this repo
